# Coming soon

Serenity can be run from a single executable file. She will load up all the necessary files and run in the background, ready to be called upon.
You can select which voice and avatar you'd like to use, and she will remember your choice for next time.
Holding down the space bar will enable Serenity to hear you, and releasing it will finish the sentence.
