# Serenity

## What is Serenity?

Serenity is a virtual AI therapist, which can be used to help people with their mental health, and be someone who can aid in the ever-increasing amount of lonely people who currently have no alternative solution. It's designed to be as immersive as possible, and to be as human as possible. It's also designed to be as accessible as possible, so it can be used by almost anyone, anywhere, at any time.
Serenity has been specially trained on dozens of transcripts and university level degree slides, meaning she's got plenty of experience to advise with, even more than a traditional therapist. She's also constantly learning, so she'll get the newest techniques and information, rather than having 20 year-old knowledge.
The more she knows about you, the better she can help you and advise you, and she'll check back on tasks she's set you in previous sessions.

## Is my data safe?

We don't store any of your data, it's all stored on your device, unaccessible to anyone, so there's no risk of us getting hacked, or your data being stolen or sold.
Serenity can work better with the more information you provide her with, but it never leaves your device. We don't even have access to it, so you can be sure that your data is safe.
We also cannot be audited for your data from any third party organisation or government, it's completely between you and your profile.

## How did you come up with the name?

When considering a name for the project, we weren't really sure what to call it. We had many boring and generic names thought up, "Therapist-AI", "TherApIst", etc.
Eventually, we had the idea of asking Serenity herself, what we should call her, and she named herself - Serenity. We thought this was a great name, as it's a word which is often associated with mental health, and it's also a word relating to calmness, which is what we want our users to feel when using Serenity.

## How does it work?

Serenity is made up of an arrangement of different units, which all work together to create the final product. These units include:

- Converting the user's voice to text
- Converting the bot's text to realistic and immersive speech
- Running sentiment analysis on the user's input, to extract additional data
- Detecting the user's keyboard input, to allow push-to-talk
- Interfacing with a Large Language Model, to generate responses
- Using her learned knowledge to incluence decision making
- And many more

## Why is it better than traditional therapy?

While Serenity's purpose is not to replace traditional therapy, it does have some advantages over it. Those who need extensive treatment should still seek professional help, but Serenity can be used as a supplement to this, and for those who don't need as much specialised help. These benefits include:

- Cost: The price of one hour with Serenity is an order of magnitude cheaper than a session with a therapist, so it much more accessible to those who can't afford it.
- Performance: Unlike a traditionally flawed human, Serenity is always at 100%, as she never gets tired, ill, or distracted, she also cannot be overworked.
- Personal service: Serenity's code means she's entirely devoted to just you, she doesn't have any other clients, so she can focus entirely on you.
- External damage: Serenity doesn't have any external factors which can affect her, such as a therapist losing someone close to them, or a therapist being in a bad mood. She's always happy to help.
- Permanent memory: Human's naturally forget things (to optimise their memory), but Serenity never forgets anything you tell her, so she can always refer back to previous sessions, she'll also never get you confused with anyone else.
- Accessibility: Serenity can be used at any time, and can be used as often as needed, you aren't required to travel by car or public transport to get to her.
- Reachable: Serenity is reachable where-ever, whenever, you don't need to wait for an appointment, or for her to be available. She can also be accessed from anywhere.
- Stigma: Many people are embarrassed to go to therapy, or feel they don't need it, but Serenity can be used privately in the comfort of your own home, and for a price that is much more affordable, unlocking the access to therapy for everyone.
- Nine-to-five: Like many other services, therapists are often only available during working hours, but Serenity is available 24/7, so you're able to talk to her whenever you need to. You can do it in the middle of the night, or on a Sunday morning, during your lunch hour - it's up to you, Serenity is always there for you.
- Extendable: In traditional therapy, when the hour is over, the conversation comes to a close, potentially leaving the client admist a vulnerable story. With Serenity, you can easily extend the session, and finish the conversation on your own terms.
- Relatable: Finding a therapist that you feel comfortable with isn't an easy task, but with the ability to choose from multiple different avatars and voices, you're much more likely to find someone you feel comfortable with.
- Judgement: Serenity doesn't gossip, nor does she have the capacity to judge you, so you know not only that your secret is safe, but you can share absolutely anything, and she'll be happy to listen.
- Commitment: To commit to a real person, opening yourself up, speaking through your problems, and being vulnerable is a big step, but with Serenity, you can take it at your own pace, and you there is almost no commitment, you can decide after the first session if you want to continue.

- Diversity: While many different products can only reach a hugely reduced section of the market, Serenity can be used by almost anyone, albeit if they're English-speaking and over 18 years old. Men, women, the elderly, young adults, traditional people, modern ideologies, any religion, orientation, ethnicity can use Serenity, so she's much more accessible than other products.

## How can I use it?

Serenity can be used with a simple laptop or desktop, but is better used with a webcam. Simply hold the space bar while you're talking, and release when you've finished, and Serenity will do the rest. The interaction should feel closely like a traditional video call environment, and we're always working to improve how you interact with Serenity.

## What's coming next?

We have big plans with Serenity, and we're always looking to improve her. Some of the things we're working on include:

- More conversation AI: We're always looking to improve Serenity's conversation AI, so she can have more natural conversations, and be able to talk more conversationally. This includes natural pauses, filler words and being less direct (such as "Maybe we should try this" instead of "We should try this").
- Improved knowledge base: We're always improving the amount of knowledge Serenity has, so she can give more accurate and helpful advice. This includes more knowledge on mental health, and more knowledge on general councelling topics. The more time she has to learn, the better she'll be.
- Improve immersion: While we've already made big steps to improve how immersive Serenity is, this is a never ending battle, to make it as seamless as possible. This includes improving the voice, the avatar, the background, and the overall experience, especially the latency between you speaking and Serenity responding.
- Improved interfacing: We want using the application to be as easy as possible, so we're always looking to improve the interface, and make it as intuitive as possible. This includes user-testing and also a lot of engineering and designing.
- Removing STT: One of the main improvements we'd like to make to the application is removing the push-to-talk requirement, and instead always detecting if the user is speaking. This is a technical challenge, but would be the ideal way to use the application.
- More devices: We'd love to have the ability to use Serenity availible on almost any device, including smart phones, Apple laptops, and tablets. This would include doing most of the processing and storage on our own servers, which might pose and a trust risk with some users.
