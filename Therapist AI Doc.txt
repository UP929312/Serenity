A virtual AI therapist

- Immersive as possible (no uncanny voices or faces)
- Also has to respond relatively quickly to avoid long awkward pauses.

- Speech to Text (user) - Done
- Text to Speech (bot) - In progress
- Digital Face with expressions
- Face reading, for emotion
- Natural pauses and mannerisms
- Remember everything the user has done so far, to build a report (store in fast vector database)
- Refer back to previous sessions, to track/measure progress
 
- Build it's own list of goals for the user, which they can slowly check off when progressing
- The AI should permanently remember previous conversations, and refer back to them when needed.
- All learned facts about the user should also be included in the report, and used to help the user.


Tensor storage:

We need to store the data the the user inputs while chatting with a bot. This data will be used to train the bot, and also to build a report for the user.
The messages wil be stored in one hot encoding https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/
